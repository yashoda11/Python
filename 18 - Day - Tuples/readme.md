# Tuples :

**Tuples :**
- tuples are immutable.(cannot add or remove)
- parentheses ()
- Tuples are handy when you need to store data that should remain unchanged throughout your program's execution. 
- Their immutability makes them suitable for certain use cases, providing a safe and efficient way to group related data.

**Creating Tuples :**
```# Example: Creating a tuple
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange")
coordinates = (3.14, 2.71)
```

**Accessing Elements :**
```# Example: Accessing elements in a tuple
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange")

print(fruits[0])  # Output: "apple"
print(fruits[2])  # Output: "orange"
```

**Tuple Packing and Unpacking:**
```# Example: Tuple packing and unpacking
person = ("John", 30, "New York")
name, age, city = person

print(name)  # Output: "John"
print(age)   # Output: 30
print(city)  # Output: "New York"
```

**Tuple Functions :**
- Tuples support various built-in functions like len(), min(), and max().

```# Example: Tuple functions
numbers = (5, 2, 8, 1, 7)

# Length of the tuple
length = len(numbers)
print(length)  # Output: 5

# Maximum and minimum elements in the tuple
maximum = max(numbers)
minimum = min(numbers)
print(maximum, minimum)  # Output: 8 1
```

**Tuple Concatenation and Repetition :**
```# Example: Tuple concatenation and repetition
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)

# Concatenation
result = tuple1 + tuple2
print(result)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# Repetition
repeated_tuple = tuple1 * 3
print(repeated_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)
```
