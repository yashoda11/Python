# Working with Sets

**Working with Sets :**

1. **Set Operations :**

```set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Union of two sets
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Intersection of two sets
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3, 4}

# Difference between two sets
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}

# Symmetric Difference (elements in either set, but not in both)
symmetric_difference_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
print(symmetric_difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}
```

2. *8Membership Test :**

```my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(3 in my_set)  # Output: True
print(6 not in my_set)  # Output: True
```
